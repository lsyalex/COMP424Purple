<!--Project Introduction-->
<h3>Overview</h3>
Purple is an expense tracking application that allows the users to customize expenditure categories and view textual and graphical summaries of their expenses. There will be a login page, a user homepage, a user spending page, and a user budgeting page. The user will add their income and spending information into the app and will be able to view textual and graphical summaries of their expenditures. They will also be able to group their expenditures by adding/editing spending categories.<br>
<h3>User Home Page</h3>
The primary goal of the user homepage is to give an overview of a userâ€™s expenses for the week and a summary of their key spending metrics such as total expenditures, highest expense category, and change in spending from previous weeks. From the home page users can navigate to the Spending and Budgeting pages.<br>
<h3>Spending</h3>
In the Spending section of the app the user will be able to add main expenditure categories such as Food, Bills, and Travel. They will then be able to drill down into these categories and view their expenses and expense summaries for each category. These categories can have additional sub-categories. For example, the Bills category may be further subdivided into Medical, Car, Utilities, and School groups. Within the different categories users will be able to add their transaction information.<br>
<h3>Budgeting</h3>
In the Budgeting section of the app the user will be able to create budgets and time based budgeting goals. The user will be able to input an expected spending amount and a spending goal. As their income and expense information is updated, they will be able to track their goal progress.<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
We want the user to be able to access summarized information and graphical representations of these summaries at any level of granularity within their spending categories.
